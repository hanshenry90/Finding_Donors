    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_raw'` data.\n",

    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",

    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. "

    "Naive Bayes (NB) can be used in a text classificaiton task - sentimental classification. For example, based on the words extracted from online social medias, predict if the this person is happy nor not happy(https://inclass.kaggle.com/c/si650winter11). Because it assumes features (words) are independent of eachother, NB classifier can compute high dimential features (words) very quickly on training data. The weakness is also that it assumes feature independency. Because words are not related to each other (however it is only to happyness or unhappyness) it can confuse NB when lots of happy words appear in the unhappy texts. On the other hand, it can also happen when both happy and unhappy texts have identical words. For example, cry can be unhappy or happy, depending on the context. This problem contains 33052 data points (sentences) and probably over 5000 discrete features (words) and only 2 classes - happy and unhappy feeling. All NB does is just keep muliplying discrete features, updating prior probability and make inferences on the classes the words belong. The flat simple muliplications makes the computational complexity very fast, for example, is only O(5000*2) = O(10000).\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, Support Vector Machine (SVM) is one the best and widely used supervised learning classifiers today which is not based on probability(once it is trained, it gives 100% certainty of the data point class). The SVM works on seperating data points. First, it lays the data points on a multi-demensional \"space\" and learns to seperate data points belonging to different classes in linear fashion and maximizes the gap betwen them, so that the split is not biased to neither side of class and has equal potential to expect incoming real world data set. Second, the SVM takes new data point into the \"space\" and predicts which class, depending on where does it fall on the side of seperation. The SVM performs extremly well when the data set is small, but it performs poorly when the data set is large because it takes too much time training. The SVM outperforms other models in small image recognition such as recognizing handwritten digits(https://shankarmsy.github.io/posts/svm-sklearn.html). Because the image data feature (pixels) is continuous, the non-linear kernel (rbf) makes it possible a smoothier seperation boundary between different images in higher dimensional space.\n",

    "Decision Tree is a method that splits data points into a tree of leaves througth branches, by dicisions made on each level of branches. These decisions are learnt by asking simple questions, like a game of 20 questions. The answers are then turned into numerical representations and form thresholds on a multi-dimentional space. The tresholds are then become decision bondaries that group data points into clusters of classes, based on entropy, a method of maximizing purity: grouping similar data points, and eliminating and filtering out imuprity: the data points that are different. The Decision Tree iterates asking quesitons, turning them into numerical decision boundaries on each level of tree branches, and grouping similar data points and eliminating different ones untill it reaches the single data point, where a data point can not be further split and the class of each data point is decided. One application of Decision Tree is to predict for the bank if the loans are going to be paid on time(https://www.kaggle.com/kubo56/analysis-decision-tree-default-prediction). It is good because it takes larger data set and takes resonable time to train. Also its tree graph is easy to understand and interprete. The less useful features can be discarded and only more important features are remained for building model. The logic is easily explained by boolen logic. It works on both numerical and categorical data. However it can happend at the times when input training data changes a bit, resulting in big change in the tree structure and final predictions. It can also be a problem when Decision Tree overfits the training data and does not generalize well leading to high variance error and reducing accuracy. "

    "### Implementation - Creating a Training and Predicting Pipeline\n",
    "To properly evaluate the performance of each model you've chosen, it's important that you create a training and predicting pipeline that allows you to quickly and effectively train models using various sizes of training data and perform predictions on the testing data. Your implementation here will be used in the following section.\n",
    "In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Import `fbeta_score` and `accuracy_score` from [`sklearn.metrics`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#sklearn-metrics-metrics).\n",
    " - Fit the learner to the sampled training data and record the training time.\n",
    " - Perform predictions on the test data `X_test`, and also on the first 300 training points `X_train[:300]`.\n",
    "   - Record the total prediction time.\n",
    " - Calculate the accuracy score for both the training subset and testing set.\n",
    " - Calculate the F-score for both the training subset and testing set.\n",
    "   - Make sure that you set the `beta` parameter!"

    "**Answer: ** Based on the graph on Performance Metrics for Three Supervised Learning Models, I believe the SVM would be the best fit the problem. As you can see, the accuracy score on testing set is the highest (84.6%). Comparing with DecisionTreeClassifier, the lower accuracy score on the training set indicates that the model learns the dataset well instead memorizing/overfitting the training set like for example DecisionTreeClassifier. As you can see clearly in the graph, DecisionTree overfits the training data and both Accuracy adn F-score is perfectly 100%, however, SVM outperforms it in testing set. The drawback for SVM is the training time which takes the longest among all three models, about 156 seconds. However it does affect the performace on this particular problem because time is an import factor. I will need to run overnight to compute the final result with C=1000. The F-score on testing set is about 0.7 when trained on 100% on training set size and this indicates that 70% of the predictions on high income (>50K) are accurate and only 30% of the prediciton population are mistaken as high income. Over all the SVM will not be a very good candidate considering such large data set with many features, without feature reduction."

    "**Answer: ** Hello CharityML, I have just worked out for you one of the best models which is excellent for this particular job in predicting individuals' income based on the specific information provided such as age and working hours per week. The dataset you gave to me is split into two: train and test. The model SVM is trained on the train set and learns to identify high incomes (income >50K) and low incomes (income <=50K) and finds for itself the best boundary to seperate them, meaning that it passes through the middle of the data points from high income and low income. It maximizes the gap between data points on both sides. The model then tests on the test set and makes predicitons. Using this boundary, it thinks high income if a new person's information provided falls on the high income side, and thinks low income if it falls on the low income side. "

    "- Create a dictionary of parameters you wish to tune for the chosen model.\n",
    " - Example: `parameters = {'parameter' : [list of values]}`.\n",
    " - **Note:** Avoid tuning the `max_features` parameter of your learner if that parameter is available!\n",
    "- Use `make_scorer` to create an `fbeta_score` scoring object (with $\\beta = 0.5$).\n",
    "- Perform grid search on the classifier `clf` using the `'scorer'`, and store it in `grid_obj`.\n",

However, the unoptimized model is much better (Accuracy=0.8184) and the optimized model (Accuracy=0.8548) is even better! This is because the Decision Tree takes into considerations of every possible information about an individual and come up with a well informed decision! The F(beta=0.5)-score steadly increases and reaches 0.72 meaning 72% of the prediction popuplation over high income are truly high income(>50K) and only 28% of the population are wrongly believed to be high income, which is the best of all three models!"

The ones I missed are capital-loss and age. I think capital-loss is more relevant than my guess on occupation and education-level because it directly causes one to lose huge amount of income when in bad luck or short of insight of the way business going to grow in future. Age is also more relevant because I suppose the older one becomes the more income it scales upon (at least it is true in US and Canada)"

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

It might not be obvious in the case of DecisionTreeClassifier but it certainly is in SVM. Although the training time is not a great factor in this problem, it will defintely make it much faster when it becomes a problem like in human face recognition and handwritten notes on cheques. In sum, if it is SVM that takes long to train, I will definitely use the reduced data for predicitons!"
